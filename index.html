<h1>
The Busby Babes
</h1>

<p>
The "Busby Babes" were the group of footballers, recruited and trained by Manchester United<br> chief scout Joe Armstrong and assistant manager Jimmy Murphy,<br>  who progressed from the club's youth team into the first team under the management of the eponymous Matt Busby from<br>  the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s. The squad most associated with the name<br>  "babes" was that of the 1957â€“58 season, many of whom died in the 1958 Munich air disaster, and who, with an average age <br> of 22, had been touted to dominate European football for the next few years.
